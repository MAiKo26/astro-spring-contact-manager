# Contact Manager

## Overview

Welcome to the Contact Manager repository! This project is a simple CRUD application with a Spring Boot backend and an Astro Front-End for managing contacts. Followed this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LUA-LHXobE&t=5908s) to build the Spring Boot Back-End and then added some modifications of mine and the Front-End.

## Spring Boot Backend

The Spring Boot backend provides API endpoints for basic CRUD operations on contacts. It uses an H2 in-memory database for simplicity.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-manager.git`
2. Open the `contact-manager` directory.
3. Run the application: `./gradlew bootRun`

## Astro Front-End

The Astro Front-End offers a modern and dynamic user interface for managing contacts.

### How to Run Locally

1. Open the `astro-frontend` directory.
2. Run the development server: `npm install` and then `npm run start`
